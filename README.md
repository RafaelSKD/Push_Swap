# Stacks and Radix Sort: The Journey of a Coder

Welcome to my project, where I put the "stack" in "stack overflow" (but hopefully not in the way you think!). This code is a beautiful blend of algorithmic wizardry, some late-night debugging magic, and the kind of optimization that makes you question whether you really need sleep. 😅

## The Core of the Algorithm
The `main` function is the heart of this sorting saga. Here’s what it does:

- Validates the input arguments to ensure they’re correct ✅
- Allocates memory for the stacks ⚖️
- Initializes the stacks and parses the numbers 🔹
- Handles edge cases (like arrays of size 2 and 3) with simple sorting ✨
- Sorts arrays of size 4 to 5 with a specialized method 🤝
- For larger arrays, it uses **radix sort**, a powerful sorting algorithm that works in base 2! 🔏

## The Optimized Radix Sort
My radix sort has a few tricks up its sleeve to make sure it runs like a well-oiled machine:

🔧 **Bit Size Restriction**: We only compare a limited number of bits to save time and make the algorithm more efficient.

🔺 **Push Efficiency**: The `radix_sort_stack_b` function minimizes redundant rotations and pushes elements from `b` to `a` only when necessary. This saves movements and keeps the algorithm snappy! 💥

## Running the Code
To see this code in action, compile and run it with a list of integers. It’s as easy as pie (and probably faster, too)! 🍰😎

## Why This Project?
Because sorting algorithms are fun, and radix sort is an underappreciated hero! 💡 I wanted to take an algorithm that’s often overlooked and make it shine with optimizations that are practical and effective. Plus, it’s always fun to make things more efficient when you’re not the one writing it in a sleep-deprived stupor. 🌟

So, if you're tired of sorting algorithms that feel like they’re just doing their best but never quite get there, check out this little gem. It’s got the speed, the efficiency, and a hint of humor that all good code should have. 🤣🎉
